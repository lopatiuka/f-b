                                    For starters, just like us, they have grown. But unlike us, they haven’t just grown in age but in 
                                    market size. And guess what they all have in common. Yes you got it right! You can be a stock owner

                                        We are talking about an industry of ginormous proportions that turns the key players in the 
                                        sector into mega-giants that dominate the global F&B industry.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        Whether you’re in downtown New York or walking the cobbled streets of Barcelona, you can rest 
                                        assured that you’re going to come across a McDonald’s or another household name just around 
                                        the corner.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        At the same time, people’s tastes are shifting, and people become more health and 
                                        sustainability driven. So what do these companies do? They innovate! They change their menus, 
                                        add more healthy and sustainable options and evolve with the shifts in people’s needs. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In the meantime, newcomers come into play and are cementing their place in a constantly 
                                        evolving global industry. Companies like Beyond Meat and Whole Foods are simply ‘rocking it’ 
                                        in the healthy food sector. The same way that Health-Ade is brewing up a stir in the healthy 
                                        beverage sector. Enough of a stir to cause Coca-Cola to invest $20 Million in the up-and-coming 
                                        healthy drinks brand.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        So there you have it. Its pretty obvious really. Food and drinks are what fuels humans.
                                        As long as humans grow, the market will keep growing and as long as human tastes shift, the 
                                        big players will play along to the tune of human tastes.

                                <p>This is a subjective question. Earning from stocks can relate to both your entry time and 
                                    position. As an example, in 2020, Pfizer Stocks increased their value from $35 per share to 
                                    over $40. That translates to a yearly growth of over 14% which was the potential profit one 
                                    could have gained that year, and is well above any percentage any savings bank can offer.
